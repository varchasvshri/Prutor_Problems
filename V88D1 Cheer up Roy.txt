Roy is going through the dark times of his life. Recently his girlfriend broke up with him and to overcome the pain of acute misery he decided to restrict himself to Eat-Sleep-Code life cycle. For N days he did nothing but eat, sleep and code.



Roy's mother was in stress and wanted to know whether Roy is having proper sleep. So she contacted you.



You being a close friend of Roy kept an eye on him for last N days. For every single hour of the day, you kept track of Roy's actions and prepared a log file.



The log file contains exactly N lines, each line contains a string of length 24 ( i.e. number of hours in the day).

The string is made of characters E, S, and C only; representing Eat, Sleep and Code respectively. ith character of the string represents what Roy was doing during ith hour of the day.



Give Roy's mother how much Roy has slept each day.



See sample test case for clarification.



Input:

First line of each file contains N - number of days.

Following N lines contains a string of exactly 24 length representing his activity on that day.



Output:

Print number of hours has Roy slept on each day on different line.



Constraints:

1 = N = 365

String consists of characters E, S, and C only.

String length is exactly 1440.



Note: The sample test case does not follow the given constraints on string length to avoid large data. It is meant only for explanation. We assure you that the hidden test files strictly follow the constraints.
