Fredo has messed up his JEE Advanced paper and is out giving another paper. The rules of the examination are:

Fredo has to score at least A marks to clear the exam. There will be N questions to attempt. Fredo can either answer the question correctly or incorrectly or else leave it. The marking scheme of the paper is for a correct answer he will gain 3 marks and lose 1 mark if he gets the answer wrong. If he leaves the question he doesn't gain or lose a mark.



Fredo has an array Arr containing N elements corresponding to the N questions. For ith question, if Fredo gets answer correct then Arr[i]=C, else if he gets his answer wrong then Arr[i]=W else Arr[i] = L.

Fredo asks you to tell him if he will be able to clear the examination. If yes, then also tell him how much is he scoring.

If he is not able to clear the examination, then also tell him how much is he scoring.
