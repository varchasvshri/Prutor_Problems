Little Johnny after watching his favourite movie Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was quite impressed with Willy Wonka. He himself wanted to participate in a lottery but since he is underage he cannot participate in it. So little Johnny started to design an algorithm to generate a unique winning number.



You will be given 5 lines of input containing 10 integers each. From each line, a digit is generated by multiplying each of the 10 numbers and taking its unit digit. A digit is generated from each of the 5 lines and are taken together to form a five digit number. This five digit number will be the unique winning number.



Input:



5 lines of 10 integers inputs.



Output:

Print the 5 digit unique winning number.



Constraints:

1 = N = 1000
