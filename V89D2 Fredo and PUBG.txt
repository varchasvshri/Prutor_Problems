The team wins if they cross the winning score of 30 points then the team wins.



Fredo has an array Arr containing 10 elements corresponding to each of the players. If the ith player wins his jth duel , then Arr[i][j]=1 else Arr[i][j]=0.

Fredo asks you to tell him if his team won or not. Also, tell him the score so that his team could improve in future.
